IPA1024.adjlist and words1024.adjlist were obtained from https://github.com/aldo-git-bit/phonological-similarity-networks-SUBTLEX/blob/main/Adjlists/IPA/IPA1024.adjlist and https://github.com/aldo-git-bit/phonological-similarity-networks-SUBTLEX/blob/main/Adjlists/word/words1024.adjlist 

These are the smallest networks subsampled from the SUBTLEX-US corpora by John Alderete. Each file is a text file containing the adjacency list for each network. Each row's first item is the node, and the items that follow it are the node's phonological neighbors based on the 1-edit distance rule.

We are using the IPA list as a sample network for pnet-package development.
